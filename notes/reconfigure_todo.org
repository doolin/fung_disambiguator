* Instances of ~Firstname~ in the ~cpp~ files:
- attribute.cpp
  - Changed the delimiter in ~split_string()~ to ~**~ consistent
    coauthor and ipc code delimiters
  - Added ~Name~ attribute to the class definitions, inheriting from FirstName
  - QUESTION: Don't want the name classes to split automatically;
    currently they assume first/middle are in the first name
    sequence. Want to avoid that.
- blocking_operation.cpp
  - Updated ~cBlocking_Operation_By_Coauthors~ to replace ~cFirstname~
    with ~cName~; not entirely clear this is correct.
- cluster.cpp
  - Also updated the ~get_index~ function to use ~cName~; need to
    verify that the class reference is right here
- disambiguate.cpp
  - Changed all instances of cFirstname to cName
  - Changed instances of firstname_cur_truncation and
    firstname_prev_truncation to name_*_truncation
